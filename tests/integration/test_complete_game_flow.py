"""
Comprehensive integration test for the complete Blokus game flow.

This test verifies that all components work together from game initialization
through game end, including:
- Game setup and configuration
- Piece placement with rotation/flip
- Turn-based gameplay
- Rule enforcement
- Score tracking and updates
- Game end detection
- Winner determination
