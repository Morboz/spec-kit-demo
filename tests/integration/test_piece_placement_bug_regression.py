"""
Regression Test: Piece Placement Interaction Bug

This test ensures that the core piece selection → board placement interaction
bug does not reoccur. The bug manifested as: user selects piece but clicking
board has no response, no errors shown.

The fix involved:
1. Correcting callback initialization order (_setup_callbacks after UI creation)
2. Adding set_player() method to PieceSelector for turn synchronization
3. Enhanced visual feedback for piece selection

Test covers the complete interaction flow to prevent regression.
