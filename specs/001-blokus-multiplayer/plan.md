# Implementation Plan: Blokus Local Multiplayer Game

**Branch**: `001-blokus-multiplayer` | **Date**: 2025-10-30 | **Spec**: /root/blokus-step-by-step/specs/001-blokus-multiplayer/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-blokus-multiplayer/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a local multiplayer Blokus board game supporting 2-4 players on a single device. The system must enforce all official Blokus rules, provide turn-based gameplay with piece placement, rotation, and validation, and accurately track scores according to standard scoring. Core gameplay includes setting up games, placing pieces with geometric shapes, ensuring rule compliance (first move in corner, pieces touch only at corners), and determining winners based on placed pieces.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (portable, rapid prototyping, good game libraries)
**Primary Dependencies**: tkinter (standard library, no external dependencies, sufficient for 2D board game)
**Storage**: N/A (local gameplay, no persistence required)
**Testing**: pytest (unit tests), pytest-cov (coverage)
**Target Platform**: Desktop (cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single desktop application
**Performance Goals**: UI responsiveness <100ms for interactions, board rendering at 60 FPS
**Constraints**: Offline-only, no network dependencies, must run on low-end machines
**Scale/Scope**: 2-4 players, 20x20 board, 21 unique pieces per player (total 84 pieces)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Pre-Research Evaluation ✓
- [x] Principle I: Incremental Development - Implementation broken into small, verifiable steps
- [x] Principle II: Test-First Development - TDD approach planned for all game logic
- [x] Principle III: Modular Architecture - Clear separation of board, pieces, players, rules
- [x] Principle IV: Rules Compliance - Plan to implement exact Blokus rules with validation
- [x] Principle V: Clear Documentation - Documentation approach defined for all interfaces

### Post-Design Re-Evaluation ✓
- [x] Principle I: Incremental Development - Modular design enables small, testable increments (each component can be developed independently)
- [x] Principle II: Test-First Development - Test contracts defined for all modules (Board, Piece, Rules, Game State)
- [x] Principle III: Modular Architecture - Clear component boundaries in data-model.md; dependencies flow toward game_state
- [x] Principle IV: Rules Compliance - Comprehensive rule validation in contracts; all Blokus rules specified
- [x] Principle V: Clear Documentation - Quickstart guide enables 10-minute setup; all interfaces documented

**All Constitution Check gates PASS - Ready to proceed to task generation**

**Structure Decision**: Single desktop application with modular architecture separating game logic (models, game), UI rendering (ui), and configuration. Tests organized by type (unit/integration) and map to components. Follows Principle III (Modular Architecture) by clearly separating concerns.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
