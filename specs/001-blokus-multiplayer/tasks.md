# Tasks: Blokus Local Multiplayer Game

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-blokus-multiplayer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This implementation follows TDD approach as per Constitution Principle II. Tests are written first for all game logic.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths assume single project structure from plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure) ✅ COMPLETE

**uv Commands Reference**:
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
  - CRITICAL: All models (Piece, Board, Player, GameState) must be complete before any user story
  - Rules validator and Scoring must be complete before user stories
  - Unit tests for all foundational components must pass
- **User Stories (Phases 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if team capacity allows)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 and US2 for game state
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US2 and US3 for placement and state visibility
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1, US2, US3 for setup, placement, and visibility
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US2 for piece placement functionality
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US2, US3, US4 for placement, visibility, and end game

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (TDD approach) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before UI integration
- Core implementation before integration testing
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can be developed in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Game Setup)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for Board initialization in tests/contract/test_board_init.py"
Task: "Contract test for Player creation in tests/contract/test_player_creation.py"

# Launch all UI components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement game setup UI in src/ui/setup_window.py"
Task: "Implement GameSetup orchestrator in src/game/game_setup.py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Game Setup)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Game Setup independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Basic game creation!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Core gameplay!)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Visibility!)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Complete game!)
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Turn management!)
7. Add User Story 6 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Rule enforcement!)
8. Add User Story 7 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Score tracking!)
9. Polish phase → Final product

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Game Setup)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Placing Pieces)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Game State Visibility)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Game End)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Then tackle P2 and P3 stories in parallel

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach per Constitution)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

**Total Tasks**: 91 tasks across 10 phases
**P1 Stories**: 4 (Game Setup, Placing Pieces, Game State Visibility, Game End)
**P2 Stories**: 2 (Turn-Based Flow, Rule Enforcement)
**P3 Stories**: 1 (Score Tracking)
**Parallelizable Tasks**: 46 tasks marked [P]
**Critical Path**: Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 (Complete playable game!)
